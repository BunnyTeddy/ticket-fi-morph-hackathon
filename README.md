Ticket-Fi: The Future of Fan-Powered Finance

Vision
Beyond ticketing. We fix consumer finance for fans with a "Buy Now, Pay Later" model. Our NFT marketplace ensures fair artist royalties, and tickets evolve into stakeable assets, powering a new fan economy on Morph.

The Problem
The live event industry is broken. For consumers, high ticket prices create a huge financial barrier, while the secondary market is plagued by scalpers, driving prices up and offering no value back to the artists. Existing Web3 ticketing solutions only solve the "authenticity" problem but fail to address the core financial issues.

Our Solution: Ticket-Fi
Ticket-Fi is not just a ticketing platform; it is a consumer finance protocol for events, built on Morph. Our solution has three core pillars designed to financialize the entire fan experience:

Ticket Accessibility (BNPL): We introduce a "Buy Now, Pay Later" and deposit system, allowing fans to secure tickets for major events without the upfront financial burden.

Fair & Transparent Secondary Market: Our on-chain marketplace uses the ERC-2981 royalty standard to automatically distribute a percentage of every resale back to the artist, fighting scalping and creating a new revenue stream for creators.

Tickets as Financial Assets (Fan Staking): Post-event, tickets transform into "Proof-of-Attendance" assets. Fans can stake these assets to invest in their favorite artists and earn rewards, creating a new, decentralized, fan-centric economy.

Midpoint Check-in Progress
✅ Core Backend Infrastructure (100% Complete)
Smart Contracts: The entire suite of smart contracts has been written in Solidity and successfully deployed on the Holesky testnet.

EventManager.sol: A factory contract for creating new events.

TicketNFT.sol: An advanced ERC-721 contract with built-in royalty standards (ERC-2981) and enumerable extensions.

TicketMarketplace.sol: A decentralized secondary marketplace contract.

TicketBNPL.sol: The core escrow contract for our "Buy Now, Pay Later" feature.

Development Environment: Professional setup using Hardhat and TypeScript.

✅ Core Frontend Infrastructure (60% Complete)
Technology: Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Wagmi for a modern, fast, and reliable user experience.

Core Features Implemented:

Wallet Connectivity (MetaMask, Bitget Wallet, etc.).

Event Creation Page: A fully functional admin page for organizers to create new events on-chain.

Homepage: Displays all events fetched directly from the EventManager smart contract.
